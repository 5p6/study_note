There is a meaningful picure named during the way,two man are climating a mountain,while one man declare that it is so tought that i could no climb any more,which reflects give in,and the other one declare that we could climb a bit more,which reflects the persistence.
Admittedly,this phenomenon is normal in the reality,someone will meet some diffculties during accompanylishing a object.For example, the Edison made the bulb by thunands different bulbs,it is his persistence that lead him to success,
