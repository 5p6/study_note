With the development in the society,a increasing number of opportunities emmerged , However when the opportunity comes,the hard and tough problem comes,some of young people may solve it clearly by action power,but some of the young people thougt that it is too hard to accomplish it,which paired with drawings in the texts.
the Action power,to my understanding,is the key to catch those opportunites successfully, there is no doubt that it is imperative for the young individuals to get more action power,do not only it lead the young people to get more enthusiasm over before,but also help the young people in the future life. 
As a senior,in my view,I deem that it is significant to foster a positive and opitimistic atmosphere to stimulate the action power from young individuals,which enable the young become more vivid.
