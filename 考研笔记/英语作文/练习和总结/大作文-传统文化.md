The modern Chinese culture festival are inherit from the before dynasty,which reflects the strong and sigificant spirit from the ancients,such as the Spring Festival,Mid-Autumu Festival and so on,all the festivals are  standed for the great and beautiful spirit by launching some food or sport activities.
Admittedly,with the development of country,not only do the atomsphere of those festivals are generally reducted,but also the young man  who inherit the traditional skills are becoming less than before.
as a senior in the university,I deem that the society should foster a positive atomsphere to learn about the Chinese Traditional culture.Meanwhile,it is advisable for the young individuals to actively participate in studying and preserving the traditional skills.
